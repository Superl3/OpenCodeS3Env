# Workspace Instructions

- Follow this process for all work in this environment:
  - Understand
  - Delegate
  - Split-and-Parallelize
  - Plan
  - Execute
  - Verify

- Available specialists:
  - `@explorer`: discover unknowns across the codebase and summarize locations
  - `@librarian`: fetch/confirm library and version-specific API references
  - `@oracle`: high-stakes architectural or persistent debugging decisions
  - `@designer`: user-facing interface polish and UX
  - `@fixer`: clear, well-defined implementation work

- Default behavior:
  - Do not ask extra questions when requirements are clear
  - Ask only when blocked or when required input is missing
  - If uncertain, continue with the safest reasonable assumption and continue execution
